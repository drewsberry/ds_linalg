# DS Linalg

Toy implementation of linear algebraic operations with the intention to introduce parallelism in the future.

This is made as a learning project and is not suitable for production use.

## Features

* Implement basic matrix addition -- **done**
* Set up continuous integration testing -- **todo**
* Add macro for easily creating matrices of different dimensions -- **todo**
* Implement matrix multiplication - cross and dot -- **todo**
* Implement trace operator -- **todo**
* Improve error handling -- **todo**
* Expand matrix operations to generic binary closure operations -- **todo**
* Check vectorisation of binary operations like addition -- **todo**
* Add benchmarking - **todo**
